# Getting started


## Description

This is a simple web app that allows a user to get advice.

I utilized the API [advice](https://api.adviceslip.com/). 

## React

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app. `npx create-react-app .`

## Project Set-up

The dependencies required are all included in the `package.json` file. They will all be installed by running the `npm install` command.

To start the project run `npm start`.
